		Surrounded by rolling hills, ï»¿the landscape in and around the ranch is a picturesque 
		representation of the northern part of the Texas Hill Country. Graham is home to the 
		largest downtown-square in the nation, and it boasts antique and boutique shopping 
		alike. Possum Kingdom Lake has several beautiful water-front resorts, most notably 
		The Cliffs, which is also known to have one of the toughest and most beautiful golf 
		courses in Texas. The ranch is located 6 miles southeast of Graham, Texas on Highway 16, just to the south 
		of the nearby Wildcatter Ranch
